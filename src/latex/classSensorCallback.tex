\label{classSensorCallback}\index{SensorCallback@{SensorCallback}}


This is a C++ library that includes abstract functions for both Soar and Hall Effect sensors. Built into this library are the following attributes\+: 1-\/ Multi\+Threading with calbacks for each sensor to run in parallel. 2-\/ Functions for each sensor in the system. 3-\/ Values that each thread can access simultaneously. 3-\/ Sensors Callback classes that return the readings of each sensor.
