We are a group of graduate students currently studying at University of Glasgow. This is our course project for Real-\/\+Time Embedded Programming Project advised by Dr. Bernd Porr and Dr. Nicholas Bailey. For our team, two members major in Robotics \& Ai, one member majors in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.~\newline


Our project, Cycle Buddy, is a system that detects cars that endanger the bikers on the road. Once the car overpasses our biker in a relative high speed and within a close distance, the system can detect this dangerous action and responds by capturing the car\textquotesingle{}s photo and recognize its car plate number. Then it will send the id, the photo and the velocity\& distance to the mobile application as long as the online database. With those infomation recorded as evidence, the bikers can then use it to contact local law enforcement to report the issue. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://developer.android.com/studio}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Android Studio}}}} ({\bfseries{Mobile Phone Application}})

​ Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device. We use it for connecting the raspberry pi and get real-\/time information from the raspberry pi, such as car distance, car velocity, and bike velocity.
\item \href{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/vs/}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Visual Studio 2019}}}} ({\bfseries{Raspberry pi threads}})

​ Visual Studio 2019 has the latest features to bring real-\/time collaboration so it is convenient for us to write C++ code for their project.
\item \href{https://firebase.google.com/}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Firebase}}}} ({\bfseries{Real time database}})

​ Firebase is Google’s mobile application development platform that helps you build, improve, and grow your app. It manages our data and stores our license plate numbers which are from the Pi camera.
\item \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Cmake}}}} ({\bfseries{Build up the full project}})

​ C\+Make is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of our choice.
\item \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Doxygen}}}} ({\bfseries{document generation tool}})

​ Doxygen is a document generation tool that extracts documents from code, organizes them, and outputs them into beautiful documents (H\+T\+ML, P\+DF, R\+TF, etc.).

​ With the Doxygen tool, programmers can write code directly in the document, no longer need to write a separate document for a function of the code, thus keeping the document and code as consistent as possible.
\item \href{https://www.openalpr.com/}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Open\+A\+L\+PR -\/ Automatic License Plate Recognition}}}} ({\bfseries{A\+PI}})

​ This A\+PI can recognize the license plate number directly from the picture, we find a GB (Great Britain, UK) lib trained model and use it.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Putty

​ Find the IP address of raspberry pi simply.
\item V\+NC (Other Remote Desktop Services are also fine)

​ Use ssh services to log in to the raspberry pi so that we do not need to use H\+D\+MI or screen to connect to the raspberry pi. It is also convenient to use UI to code in raspberry pi.
\item Typora

​ Edit markdown and Html files for Doxygen and web page.
\item \href{https://vehicleenquiry.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.97692959.1629293611.1618412250-1021591735.1618412250}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Search for the car information}}}}

​ Here is the government website to search for the car information, so when we get the license plate number, we can search for it here. ~\newline

\item \href{https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus?src=raspberrypi}{\texttt{ Raspberry Pi 3 Model B +}} (￡33.90, {\bfseries{1}} is needed, not included)

​ The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the earliest model of the third-\/generation Raspberry Pi. In our project, It can receive the real-\/time signals of the G\+P\+IO from all the sensors and deal with the real-\/time data.

​ We use a hall sensor to detect the velocity of the bike. The theory is to put the magnets On the axle of the bicycle wheel. Make sure the hall sensor is close to magnets enough so that it can detect the magnetic field when the bike runs.
\item \href{https://www.amazon.co.uk/HC-SR04-Ultrasonic-Distance-Measuring-Arduino/dp/B01DM8MRTS/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=Ultrasonic+Sensor&qid=1618407336&sr=8-7}{\texttt{ Ultrasonic sensor}}（￡3.99, {\bfseries{1}} is needed)

​ The Ultrasonic sensor is to detect the distance between the bicycle and car. Besides, according to the velocity of the bicycle, it can calculate the velocity of the car.

\item On the left, we have the results from the indoor testing, where the car plate is displayed on a phone screen.~\newline

\item On the right, we have the results from the outdoor testing, where the car plate is captured by the camera on the streets of Glasgow.~\newline

\item Moral of the story is, that the api is capable enough to recognize the car plates within any environment. Moreover, the data displayed under the Car Plate are the sensor readings at the instant of capturing the image. Thus, ensuring that the system operates in real time. ~\newline
